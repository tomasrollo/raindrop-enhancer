# Feature test results (005-add-llm-tagging)

Run date: 2025-10-08

Command: `uv run pytest -q`

Summary:

- 55 passed, 2 skipped

Full output (trimmed):

```
55 passed, 2 skipped in 6.71s
```

Notes:
- Tests include unit, integration, contract, and perf smoke tests (perf are skipped unless enabled via env).
- The test suite includes new tests covering DSPy configuration, CLI exit codes (2,3,4), normalization rules, DB migrations, and integration flows for idempotent auto-tag persistence.

Next steps:
- Consider adding a CI job that runs the test suite and records the results in a persistent artifact.
- Add perf tests to CI when reliable environment resources are available.

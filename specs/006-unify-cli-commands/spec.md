# Feature Specification: Unify CLI commands into single entrypoint

**Feature Branch**: `006-unify-cli-commands`  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Unify CLI commands - unify CLI into single entrypoint 'raindrop-enhancer' with subcommands: export, sync, capture, migrate, tag"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-10

- Q: Preferred migration strategy for the old console scripts? ‚Üí A: D
- Q: Preferred behavior when optional dependencies are missing? ‚Üí A: A


## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the CLI tools, I want a single, discoverable command `raindrop-enhancer` with multiple subcommands so I can run export, sync, capture, migrate and tagging flows using a consistent UX and shared configuration and help text.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the package is installed and on PATH, **When** the user runs `raindrop-enhancer export`, **Then** the existing behavior of `raindrop-export` runs (exporting collections) and returns the same exit code and output format as before.
2. **Given** the package is installed and on PATH, **When** the user runs `raindrop-enhancer sync`, **Then** the existing behavior of `raindrop-sync` runs (synchronization) and returns the same exit code and semantics.
3. **Given** the package is installed and on PATH, **When** the user runs `raindrop-enhancer capture`, **Then** the existing `capture-content` behavior runs and captures content as before.
4. **Given** the package is installed and on PATH, **When** the user runs `raindrop-enhancer migrate`, **Then** the existing `raindrop-migrate` behavior runs and performs migrations.
5. **Given** the package is installed and on PATH, **When** the user runs `raindrop-enhancer tag`, **Then** the existing `raindrop-tags` behavior runs and produces tags as before.

### Edge Cases
- Backwards compatibility: the old invocation names (`raindrop-export`, `raindrop-sync`, `capture-content`, `raindrop-migrate`, `raindrop-tags`) will be removed immediately as a breaking change. Release notes and upgrade/migration guidance MUST be provided to help users transition to `raindrop-enhancer <subcommand>`.
- Conflicting PATH: If `raindrop-enhancer` is not on PATH but old commands are, document migration steps.
- Missing dependencies: CLI should fail with clear error messages when optional components (e.g., dspy for tagging) are not available.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The package MUST provide a single top-level console entrypoint named `raindrop-enhancer` that exposes subcommands: `export`, `sync`, `capture`, `migrate`, and `tag`.
- **FR-002**: Each subcommand MUST map to the existing CLI behavior currently implemented by the separate entrypoints: `raindrop-export`, `raindrop-sync`, `capture-content`, `raindrop-migrate`, `raindrop-tags`.
- **FR-003**: The top-level command MUST include a `--help` that lists subcommands and shows per-subcommand help consistent with existing CLI help texts.
- **FR-004**: The transition MUST preserve exit codes and output formats for compatibility with scripts and CI that rely on the old commands.
**FR-005**: Installing the package WILL NOT create the old console scripts; old scripts will be removed immediately (breaking change). Documentation, release notes, and migration instructions MUST clearly communicate this change and provide examples for replacing existing invocations with `raindrop-enhancer <subcommand>`.
- **FR-006**: The implementation MUST ensure optional features (e.g., tagging that depends on `dspy`) remain listed as subcommands; invoking a subcommand whose optional dependency is missing MUST print a clear, actionable error message (including the exact install command) and exit with a non-zero code. The error text and install guidance MUST also be present in the CLI help and in the documentation.
- **FR-007**: Command names MUST be succinct: prefer `capture` over `capture-content` and `tag` over `tags` unless there is a compelling reason to preserve pluralization.
- **FR-008**: Documentation, README, and installation notes MUST be updated to show the new invocation pattern and migration guidance.

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: CLI MUST authenticate users using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: does this change require any auth UX/behavior changes? currently uses env vars and tokens ‚Äî confirm if unchanged]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- Not applicable ‚Äî this is a UX/CLI interface change and does not introduce new data entities.

## Notes & Implementation Considerations
- Implementation should be done in a way that minimizes breakage for existing users. Suggested technical approach (for implementers): add a new console script `raindrop-enhancer` in `pyproject.toml` that delegates to existing functions, and keep existing console script entries for a deprecation period that either call the new command or print deprecation messages.

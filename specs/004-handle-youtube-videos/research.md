# Research: Handling YouTube Videos

## Decision: Use `yt-dlp` for fetching YouTube metadata

- **Rationale**: The user explicitly requested using `yt-dlp` and provided a code snippet. This library is a well-maintained and powerful tool for extracting information from YouTube and other video sites. It directly supports fetching titles and descriptions without downloading the video, which is exactly what the feature requires.
- **Alternatives considered**: None, as the user's choice was clear and appropriate for the task.

# Feature Specification: Handle Youtube Videos

**Feature Branch**: `004-handle-youtube-videos`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Handle youtube videos - when the link is a Youtube video download the title and the description using the yt-dlp Python library. See @source_docs/yt-dlp_snippet.md for a code snippet of how to do it"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When a YouTube video's title or description cannot be fetched (e.g., it's private, deleted, or age-restricted), how should the system respond? ‚Üí A: Store placeholders like `[YOUTUBE VIDEO NOT AVAILABLE]` in the title and description fields.
- Q: Where should the extracted YouTube title and description be stored? ‚Üí A: store the title and description together in a Markdown format in the column 'content_markdown' in the database.
- Q: Should the system only handle YouTube links, or should it also attempt to extract content from other video platforms (e.g., Vimeo, Dailymotion)? ‚Üí A: No, only focus on YouTube for this feature.
- Q: When a URL is identified as a potential YouTube link but is malformed (e.g., `youtube.com/wat_ch?v=...` instead of `youtube.com/watch?v=...`), how should the system handle it? ‚Üí A: Log a warning and treat it as a non-YouTube URL.
- Q: How should the extracted YouTube title and description be formatted within the `content_markdown` field? ‚Üí A: # {title}\n\n{description} (Title as H1, description as paragraph)
- Q: What should the system do if the yt-dlp library fails with an unexpected error (e.g., a network issue, a temporary YouTube outage, or a library bug)? ‚Üí A: Store a different placeholder, like `[YOUTUBE METADATA FETCH FAILED]`.
- Q: To prevent the system from hanging on slow network requests, should there be a timeout for fetching YouTube metadata? ‚Üí A: Yes, a 30-second timeout.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, when I provide a link to a Youtube video, I want the system to extract the video's title and description so that I can have that information associated with the link.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Youtube video URL, **When** the system processes the link, **Then** the video's title and description are saved.
2. **Given** a URL that is not a valid Youtube video, **When** the system processes the link, **Then** it is handled as a regular link without attempting to extract Youtube-specific metadata.

### Edge Cases
- If a Youtube video is private, deleted, or age-restricted, the system will store `[YOUTUBE VIDEO NOT AVAILABLE]` as the title and description.
- If a potential YouTube URL is malformed, the system will log a warning and treat it as a standard web link.
- If the `yt-dlp` library encounters an unexpected error during metadata extraction, the system will store `[YOUTUBE METADATA FETCH FAILED]` as the content.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST identify if a given URL is a Youtube video link.
- **FR-002**: If the URL is a Youtube video, the system MUST extract the video title.
- **FR-003**: If the URL is a Youtube video, the system MUST extract the video description.
- **FR-004**: The extracted title and description MUST be combined into a Markdown format of `# {title}\n\n{description}` and stored in the `content_markdown` field associated with the original link.
- **FR-005**: If the URL is not a Youtube video, the system MUST process it as a standard web link.
- **FR-006**: In cases where a YouTube video's title or description cannot be fetched, the system MUST store the placeholder text `[YOUTUBE VIDEO NOT AVAILABLE]` in both the title and description fields.
- **FR-007**: If a URL appears to be a malformed YouTube link, the system MUST log a warning and treat it as a standard web link.
- **FR-008**: If the `yt-dlp` library fails with an unexpected error, the system MUST store the placeholder text `[YOUTUBE METADATA FETCH FAILED]` in the `content_markdown` field.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Metadata extraction from YouTube MUST time out after 30 seconds.

## Out of Scope
- This feature will only support YouTube links. Other video platforms like Vimeo or Dailymotion are not in scope.

## Technical Notes
The user has specified that the `yt-dlp` library should be used. Here is a snippet for reference:
```python
from yt_dlp import YoutubeDL

url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID"

video_title = None
video_description = None

with YoutubeDL() as ydl:
    info_dict = ydl.extract_info(url, download=False)
    video_title = info_dict.get('title', None)
    video_description = info_dict.get('description', None)
```
